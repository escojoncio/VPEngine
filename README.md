# VPEngine

A native engine for running PlayStation 4 games on Apple Vision Pro, built from the pieces that
the AstroVisionPro and PTVisionPro ports had to invent one at a time:

- **`tools/vpaot`** — an ahead-of-time translator: the game's x86-64 executable becomes C, which
  clang compiles into the app as ordinary arm64 code. No JIT at run time, so no debugger
  attachment, no executable memory, and the translated code is clean, signed pages that do not
  count against the process's memory limit. See [docs/PLAN.md](docs/PLAN.md).
- **`runtime/`** — the x86-64 machine state and instruction semantics the translated C calls
  (header-only, exact flags, SSE), and a small host that enters translated code.
- **`platform/visionos/`** — the Swift layer every game app shares: the VPS4 folder, controllers
  (DualSense, DualShock 4, PlayStation VR2 Sense with tracking), logs, language.
- **`tests/aot/`** — differential tests: every case runs natively on an x86-64 host and as
  translated C, from the same state, and the results must match bit for bit. The arm64 CI job
  then runs the translated C on ARM against the states the x86 job recorded.

Status: the translator handles the integer, control-flow, SSE/AVX-128 and atomic instructions
compilers emit (99.96 % of libstdc++'s 900k instructions), jump tables, C++ landing pads, direct
and indirect calls and native imports; it passes the differential suite and a whole-program test,
and the translated code runs at 1.05–1.13× the speed of native x86 (clang -O2). What a whole game still needs is listed in
[docs/PLAN.md](docs/PLAN.md). No game data is included or needed to build or test.

## Build and test

```sh
git clone --recursive <this repository> && cd VPEngine
cmake -S tools/vpaot -B build/vpaot -G Ninja && ninja -C build/vpaot
python3 tests/aot/run.py            # needs gcc/clang and binutils; native comparison on x86-64
./build/vpaot/vpaot --elf /bin/ls   # coverage report of any x86-64 ELF (or a PS4 SELF)
```

XenonRecomp static recompilers, AstroQuest and pt-ipad; the repository owner contributed ideas on
how some things could be adapted.
