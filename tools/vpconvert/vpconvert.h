 * vpconvert: a PS4 game's code (eboot.bin and the .prx files in sce_module) turned into a game pack on the
 * device that runs it, with no PC: vpaot translates each module to C, clang (linked in, run in
 * this process) compiles the pieces in parallel, lld (also linked in) links them into one Mach-O
 * library that the app then signs and loads (see platform/visionos/Sources/VPGamePack.swift).
 *
 * Resumable: everything lives in `work_dir`; a module translated before is not translated again,
 * a piece compiled before is not compiled again, and each piece's C is deleted once compiled. A
 * stop request (should_stop) ends the run after the pieces being compiled, returning 1.
