 * Signs a thin arm64 Mach-O (a game pack built with `ld64.lld -adhoc_codesign`) with a
 * developer certificate, the way codesign does, so that the app that was signed with the same
 * certificate (by SideStore) can dlopen it without JIT: the kernel only maps code whose signature
 * chains to Apple and whose team matches the app's.
 *
 * Portable C, no crypto library: SHA-256 is here; the one private-key operation (an RSA PKCS#1
 * v1.5 or ECDSA signature over SHA-256) is done by the caller in between, with whatever holds the
 * key (Security.framework on the headset, OpenSSL in the tests):
 *
 *   VpCodesign* s = vp_codesign_begin(path, "com.example.pack", leaf, n, chain, lens, k, err, sizeof err);
 *   size_t len; const uint8_t* attrs = vp_codesign_to_sign(s, &len);
 *   ... signature = sign(key, attrs, len) ...
 *   vp_codesign_finish(s, signature, sig_len, is_ec, err, sizeof err);   (also frees s)
 *
 * The file at `path` is changed in place (its signature replaced, __LINKEDIT resized): work on a
